**Working title** – Electronic Voting System using Blockchain

**Executive Summary** – This project is mainly to build Blockchain based solution for solving various problems faced in traditional voting process. This project is to design and build an electronic voting system, where we use of Solidity Smart Contracts to create a decentralized voting application. 

**Key Modules**
 - Electronic voting system consists of organizing authority, a voting machine and a vote.
 - This is a decentralized web application, main components are mentioned below.
 - Smart Contracts
 	- Ballot smart contract
 		- The Ballot smart contract is where the votes are recorded.
 	- Election creation smart contract
 		- The election creation smart contract is what is used to deploy the   ballots on the blockchain.
  Front-end for Election Commission, Voter’s interface.
  Voter Authentication Services

**Resources required** – Ethereum Solidity smart contracts, Java Script, HTLM, CSS, Node.js

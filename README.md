• Working title – Electronic Voting System using Blockchain

•Executive Summary – This assignment is mainly to build Blockchain based solution for solving various problems faced in traditional voting process. This project is to design and build an electronic voting system, where we use of Solidity Smart Contracts to create a decentralized voting application. 

•Project Background, Objectives – 

This project is mainly to build Blockchain based voting system to solve various problems involved in traditional voting system mentioned below.
Traditional paper-based voting, voting via digital voting machines, or an online voting system.
	Security Issues	
        Transparency Issues
	Hacking Issues
	Fraud

c.Key Modules 
Electronic voting system consists of organizing authority, a voting machine and a vote.
In case of system, used Ethereum based blockchain to establish the network between the three mentioned entities.

This is a decentralized web application, main components are mentioned below.

  Smart Contracts
  	Ballot smart contract
	 -The Ballot smart contract is where the votes are recorded.
	Election creation smart contract
	 -The election creation smart contract is what is used to deploy the   ballots on the blockchain.
  Front-end for Election Commission, Voter’s interface.
  Voter Authentication Services

d.Relevance — This assignment mainly helps in understanding and developing the blockchain based application, which is part of the degree program.

e.Resources required – Ethereum Solidity smart contracts, 
                       Java Script, HTLM, CSS, Node.js

f.Advantages – The Key advantages of using blockchain voting system are
	a.Transparency,
	b.Immutable
	c.Secure 

g.Risks/Disadvantages– The Key areas where blockchain applications can fail are 
	a.Adaptability, Scalability
	b.Slower progress, Self-Maintenance
	c.High Cost, Still not mature  

g.Details -
   1. Voters Identity
	Voter to enter identity details 
	Identity details submitted are gets verified online with data maintained at   
	election commission organizations.
	All the information will be added to Voter Block chain 
	Smart contract will be executed that will issue Ballot 
   2. Casting the Vote 
	Polling System consult the voter blockchain ensure to verify that voter already 
	voted or not.
	User Vote is valid polling station accepts the vote, if its invalid polling station gets rejected.
	After voting vote becomes transaction and get stored in blockchain after 
	encryption.
	Once the vote is casted it cannot be modified because of the immutable 
	characteristic of block chain.
	Vote will be allowed to print the casting of the vote as proof of casting the vote.
	Voter can even audit each ballot in the ballot box and confirm if the election 
	results are accurate.
